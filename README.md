# Android Architecture Samples

These samples showcase different architectural approaches to developing Android apps. In its different branches you'll find the same app (a TODO app) implemented with small differences.


## Variations

This project hosts each sample app in separate repository branches. For more information, see the `README.md` file in each branch.



## Why a to-do app?

The app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions and testing scenarios. For more information, see the [app's specification](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/To-do-app-specification).

## Who is it for?

*   Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.
*   Advanced developers looking for quick reference.
